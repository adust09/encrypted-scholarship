# 5. Open issues

## 5.1 Technical issues

To provide stuendt's bank balance(other financial information) to the system, we need to use a method that does not expose the student's privacy. We can archive this by using TLS Notary. The information obtained via TLSN varies depending on each bank, leading to localized implementations. Is there a way to make this more generic?


## 5.2 Non-Technical issues

Additionally, in order to design a sound system, the following requirements need to be considered:

- Prevent students from obtaining benefits through fraudulent means.
- Verify that the funds are used properly for tuition and enrollment fees.

Although not proposed this time, the following improvements seem possible:

- Alice is only the initiator and one of the investors, and it is possible that people who agree with Alice's idea will co-invest
- It may be possible to extend this system as personal donations or crowdfunding.
- It would be good to prepare a fund like the Scholarship Pool and have volunteers contribute to it.
- The financial aid (needs to be repaid) system functions similar to a lending protocol. This could create another risk, but it is experimental and interesting.
- It is also possible to have regular payments made per semester
- What kind of evaluation criteria would contribute to the public good?
- It is possible to design it like Quadratic Funding
