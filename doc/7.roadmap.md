# Roadmap

todo: write a roadmap

## test

- [ ] smart contract
- [ ] tfhe-ecdsa
- [ ] client-side
- [ ] server-side
- [ ] entire system

## Additional Features

- [ ] Get students information via TLS Notary
- [ ] Integrate with Greco
  - [ ] support TFHE for Greco
  - [ ] Implement TFHE without tfhe-rs
- [ ] Frontend
  - [ ] Implement a frontend for students

## Technical Open Discussion

- The information obtained via TLSN varies depending on each bank, leading to localized implementations. Is there a way to make this more generic?
- Using technologies like thFHE, it might be possible to transfer funds from the smart contract without returning the FHE execution results to the students.
- Upgrading to zkFHE or Verifiable FHE can enhance the reliability of the FHE Server.

## Non-Technical Open Discussion

- What kind of evaluation criteria would contribute to the public good?
- It is possible to design it like Quadratic Funding
