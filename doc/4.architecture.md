Students provide information about their financial situation and social credits, and the MPC server evaluate them (this evaluation will be done privately) to decide whether the students are qualified for the financial support.

2. Student submits bank balance to the MPC server
3. MPC Verify that the bank balance is lower than the threshold and produce a zero-knowledge proof of it
4. MPC server sends Proof to smart contract
5. Smart contract verifies the proof and if success, transfer assets tot student.
