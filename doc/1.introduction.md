# 1. Introduction

This is a scholarship support system between anonymous individuals.

Students provide information, and their applications are evaluated through secure computation using private and verifiable FHE computation. Scholarships are awarded to students who meet the criteria, and the funds are transferred. Building this system on Ethereum enables the possibility of scholarships crossing borders.

## Key points

- The process from application to evaluation is encrypted, allowing students to apply for scholarships without providing personal information to a third party.
- While traditional systems take 1-2 months from application to fund transfer, this system completes the process in at most one day.
- Anyone can become a scholarship founder and anyone can receive scholarships, regardless of borders.
