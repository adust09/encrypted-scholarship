# 1. Introduction

This is a scholarship support system between anonymous individuals.

Students provide information, and their applications are evaluated through secure computation using private and verifiable FHE computation. Scholarships are awarded to students who meet the criteria, and the funds are transferred. Building this system on Ethereum enables the possibility of scholarships crossing borders.
