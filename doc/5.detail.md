# 5. Detailed Design

## 5.1 Requirements

Additionally, in order to design a sound system, the following requirements need to be considered:

- A mechanism is needed to prevent students from obtaining benefits through fraudulent means.
- A mechanism is needed to verify that the funds are used properly for tuition and enrollment fees.
- Is it possible to operate a smart contract based on zkFHE results?

## 5.2 Improvements

Although not proposed this time, the following improvements seem possible:

- Alice is only the initiator and one of the investors, and it is possible that people who agree with Alice's idea will co-invest
- It may be possible to extend this system as personal donations or crowdfunding.
- It would be good to prepare a fund like the Scholarship Pool and have volunteers contribute to it.
- The financial aid (needs to be repaid) system functions similar to a lending protocol. This could create another risk, but it is experimental and interesting.
- It is also possible to have regular payments made per semester (tracking grades would be necessary?).
